### Synopsis
Connecting Shelter Pets to Paw-Tential Soulmates, and Saving Lives by Creating Fur-Ever Matches!!!

The PuppR project is a collaborative effort that provides a mobile interface for dog-lovers to search for dogs that meet desired criteria using the Petfinder API, and allows the user to initiate contact with adoption center via email to set up a meeting between dog/dog owner and the prospective new owner. Here are the various features of this mobile app:

- A user must register/login through Facebook to gain access to the site and view any dogs, therefore a user must have an active Twitter account.
- A user can fill out a form specifying all the desired criteria (gender, size, age, and zipcode) of the dogs
- A user can submit the form and get the results of the query, return a maximum of 25 dogs in the queue. This results page is called "Pawtential Soulmates" and shows a thumbnail of the dog and the dog's name
- A user can view a dog one at a time, which shows a large image of the dog, as well as the dog's name and age.
- A user can "like" a dog by means of a pawprint icon on right side, which keeps the dog in the "Pawtential Soulmates"
 index page.
 - A user can "dislike" a dog by means of a pawprint icon on left side, which eliminates the dog from the user's Pawtential Soulmates" index page.

## Motivation

Homeless animals outnumber homeless people 5:1. Over 2 million dogs are euthanized per year. 

We, the Puppr Team, feel there is a strong need within our community for a more accessible solution to this pawblem. We're seeking to bridge the gap between people and their soulmates. 

## Tech Stack

The stack used for this project is React Native for the front-end, and a Ruby on Rails API for the backend.
